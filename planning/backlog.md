A collection of user stories for your project. Stories inside of each priority

develop each story by drawing out your [Story Sequencing](#story-sequencing).

## Must-Haves

    site i am.
    - [ ] there is a prominent title at the top of the web page
  - As a user I want to see clear logo so that it can be clear to me in which
    site i am.
    - [ ] there is a prominent logo in the top center of the web page
  - As a user I can read a clear description so that it understand the mean goal
    of the website.
    - [ ] there is a prominent description on the Home web page
