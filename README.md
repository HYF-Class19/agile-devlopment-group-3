       - Planning documents
       - Issues
       - labels, milestones and assignees
       - A Project Board
       - Pull Requests + code review
         To be a good developer you do not need to master all the programming languages you just need to learn how to plan, collaborate and communicate with your developer friends

## All About Trees

Trees are the backbone of sustaining the life of our planet. That is why we are
developing this website to raise awareness of the following points: -Trees are
the lungs of the planet and without them, we cannot get enough oxygen for life
-Trees are an important source for construction and human development -We must
teach our children how to take care of nature and grow plants and trees to reach
a sustainable future

## Instructions for use

<details>
  <summary>Getting Started</summary>

<!-- a guide to using this repository -->

1. `git clone git@github.com:HackYourFutureBelgium/template-markdown.git`
2. `cd template-markdown`
3. `npm install`

## Code Quality Checks

- `npm run format makes sure all the code in this repository is well-formatted
  (looks good).
- `npm run lint: checks to make sure all folder and file names match the
  repository conventions.
- `npm run lint:md`: Will lint all of the Markdown files in this repository.
- `npm run lint:css`: Will lint all of the CSS files in this repository.
- `npm run validate:html`: Validates all HTML files in your project.
- `npm run spell-check goes through all the files in this repository looking for
  words it doesn't recognize. Just because it says something is a mistake
  doesn't mean it is! It doesn't know every word in the world. You can add new
  correct words to the [./.cspell.JSON](./.cspell.json) file so they won't cause
  an error.
- `npm run accessibility -- ./path/to/file.html`: Runs an accessibility analysis
  on all HTML files in the given path and writes the report to
  `/accessibility_report`

## Continuous Integration (CI)

When you open a PR to `main`/`master` in your repository, GitHub will
automatically do a linting check on the code in this repository, you can see
this in the the[./.github/workflows/lint.yml](./.github/workflows/lint.yml)
file.

If the linting fails, you will not be able to merge the PR. You can double-check
that your code will pass before pushing by running the code quality scripts
locally.

## Repo Setup

- Give each member _write_ access to the repo (if it's a group project)
- Turn on GitHub Pages and put a link to your website in the repo's description
- Turn on GitHub Actions
- in the _Branches_ section of your repo's settings make sure:
  - The repository
    [requires a review](https://github.blog/2018-03-23-require-multiple-reviewers/)
    before pull requests can be merged.
  - The `master`/`main` branch must "_Require status checks to pass before
    merging_"
  - The `master`/`main` branch must "_Require require branches to be up to date
    before merging_"
