## All About Trees

Trees are the backbone of sustaining the life of our planet. That is why we are
developing this website to raise awareness of the following points: -Trees are
the lungs of the planet and without them, we cannot get enough oxygen for life
-Trees are an important source for construction and human development -We must
teach our children how to take care of nature and grow plants and trees to reach
a sustainable future.
